# Link Checker System

## Overview
The Link Checker is a powerful tool designed for website administrators and SEO specialists to assess and maintain the health of their website's link structure. It analyzes specified webpages and reports on the status and performance of all embedded hyperlinks ('interlinks'), providing crucial insights into potential site issues.

## Key Features
- **Link Extraction and Checking**: Automatically extracts and checks all interlinks from a given URL for status codes, redirects, and performance metrics.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Provides detailed reports on the HTTP status, load times, final URLs, and more, for each interlink.
- **Performance Optimization**: Helps in identifying slow-loading or broken links that could affect user experience and SEO rankings.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Offers a simple and intuitive interface for users to input URLs and view organized results, enhancing usability and accessibility.

## How It Works
1. **Input URL**: Users provide a URL of a webpage to check.
2. **Fetch and Analyze**: The system fetches the page, analyzes its content, and extracts all interlinks.
3. **Check and Report**: Each interlink is checked for its HTTP status, response time, and final destination after redirects.
4. **Display Results**: Results are displayed in an organized manner, categorized by their origin for easy navigation and analysis.

## Usage
To use the Link Checker, simply enter the URL of the webpage you want to check in the provided input field and hit the 'Check Links' button. The system will process the URL, check all interlinks, and display the results dynamically on the page.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your desired directory.
2. Ensure PHP is installed and configured on your server.
